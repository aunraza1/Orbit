            <p>This and so many more questions arise when we think about basic survival skills. Here at Empower Yourself, we are not inventing new ways to stay safe, but bringing awareness to a host of incredible life skills that everyone can learn to be fearless and strong.
                We do not learn these skills at home, school or work. Some people are streetsmart and avoid problems, but for most people, we learn these important skills after many terrible experiences. We want to remove those experiences and trauma from your life by placing this information all around you, through Education and Media. 
                </p>

            <h3 class =>What happens when I learn everything here at Empower Yourself?</h3>
            <p>Our patrons have experienced a major paradigm shift during their workshops and have learn to be more confident, bold, brave and alert. Many women have reached out to us telling us they have left abusive homes, improved relationships, started businesses or even started studying after our workshops. 
                Just the sheer amount of stress of living in a developing country with massive security lapses for women and children, poor education network, constant obstacles along the career path, in a system that isnâ€™t built to support their needs and opportunities; its enough to hold back the potential of millions of potential workers. With a culture that promotes women staying at home, Pakistan suffers greatly economically from the underutilization of its best resource: labor. Half the population of a country stuck at home doing unpaid labor, with fears of abuse, violence, blackmailing and assault as soon as they step outdoors causing them to think many times before contributing to the system. With the sheer number of child abuse cases across the nation, its safe to assume this plight affects all genders, and not just women. 
                So imagine what would happen, when you take the fear out of people. They would fly. They would help one another, they would create. They would invent. 
                <b>They would thrive. </b>
                Sometimes all you need to do is give a little nudge and knowledge, and people are ready to empower themselves. Join us in our campaign by sponsoring an activity, donating a small amount or volunteering in any one of our projects. Keep a lookout at this space for new projects to come!
